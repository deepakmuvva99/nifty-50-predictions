<br>
Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning This project involves developing a stock price prediction model for NIFTY 100 stocks using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for financial analysis.
<br>
Project Overview
<br>
Data Collection: Historical stock data for selected NIFTY 100 stocks is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API.
<br>
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and processed to calculate returns and moving averages (SMA).
<br>
Feature Engineering: Key features such as returns, SMA, and other relevant indicators are created.
<br>
Model Implementation: A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model is trained and evaluated using TimeSeriesSplit for realistic validation.
<br>
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
<br>
Visualization: The results are visualized through plots comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices and error distributions.
